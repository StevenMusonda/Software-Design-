- **SOLID Principles**: Each class has a single responsibility, and the system is easy to extend.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Redundant code has been minimized.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: The design remains straightforward.
- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**: The system focuses only on necessary features.
